# Private Data Collections on Hyperledger Fabric ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§WORK IN PROGRESSðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§
ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§In the Medical Supply Chain, there are multiple entities such as the drug manufacturers, wholesellers, pharmacies and patients. These entities share data about the pill as it moves through the chain. However, there are cases where entities want to keep some data about the pill hidden from the other entities. Consider the instance where a manufacturer have negotiated different price rates with the wholesellers. They wouldn't want the different wholesellers to be able to see the various drug rates negotiated. Having all entities on the same channel of the blockchain would inherently make every transaction between any two entities, visible to every other entity. With the introduction of private data collections, certain data parts associated with a given transaction, can be kept private from other entities.

## Intro to private data collections
A transaction with private data is different than a typical Fabric transaction in three main ways.
* The data is stored on a private database on the authorized peers (the peers which are listed in the 
collection definition). If you want to learn more about defining a private data collection, see the 
collection definition section below.
* The data is sent peer-to-peer, via the [gossip protocol](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/gossip.html). Note that because the gossip protocol is involved, this means that you must set up anchor peers 
on the channel, and ensure that the `CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT` is configured on each peer. 
* The hash of the data is sent to all peers, whether they are authorized to see the actual private data, 
so that it can be used as evidence that the transaction did occur. The hash of the data is displayed in the
diagram below.

To learn more about when private data collections, see the Fabric documentation [here](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/private-data/private-data.html#private-data). To learn a bit more about when
to use a collection within a channel vs. a separate channel, go [here](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/private-data/private-data.html#when-to-use-a-collection-within-a-channel-vs-a-separate-channel). 

## Using private data collections

To use a private data collection within your Hyperledger Fabric application, you must define a private data 
[collection definition](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/private-data-arch.html#private-data-collection-definition). The collection contains one or more private data
collections and properties such as which organizations are allowed to access the collection, and how many 
peers the private data must be disseminated to. 

Note that the syntax for the collection definition is slightly different if you are using the Fabric SDK 
versus the Fabric CLI. We will be using the Fabric SDK syntax. Take, for example, the collection definition 
below:

```
[
    {
        "name": "collectionMarbles",
        "policy": {
            "identities": [
                {
                    "role": {
                        "name": "member",
                        "mspId": "Org1MSP"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "role": {
                        "name": "member",
                        "mspId": "Org2MSP"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "policy": {
                "1-of": [
                    {
                        "signed-by": 0
                    },
                    {
                        "signed-by": 1
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        "requiredPeerCount": 1,
        "maxPeerCount": 2,
        "blockToLive": 100
    },
    {
        "name": "collectionMarblePrivateDetails",
        "policy": {
            "identities": [
                {
                    "role": {
                        "name": "member",
                        "mspId": "Org1MSP"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "policy": {
                "1-of": [
                    {
                        "signed-by": 0
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        "requiredPeerCount": 1,
        "maxPeerCount": 1,
        "blockToLive": 100
    }
]
```

In the above example, `collectionMarbles` allows **both Org1 and Org2** members of the channel to have this private data in their
private database. 
This is because the mspId of both Org1 and Org2 are listed in the policy property. 

```
"policy": {
    "1-of": [
        {
            "signed-by": 0
        },
        {
            "signed-by": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

The nested 
policy property in the above code specifies the `minimum peers required` to disseminate the private data as part of endorsement of 
the chaincode.  This means unless the minimum number of peers are met, only then the chaincode will be endorsed. In the  
example above, this means that only 1 peer is required, and it shows signed-by 0 and 1, this means that either Org1 or
Org2 can disseminate the data, and the chaincode will be endorsed.
`CollectionMarblesPrivateDetails` on the other hand, allows only members of Org1 to have the private data 
in their private database. 

## Writing chaincode with private data collections
The last piece of using private data in Hyperledger Fabric is writing chaincode that will write data to the private 
databases on the peers. This is done by using the [putPrivateData](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-chaincode-node/release-2.0/api/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#putPrivateData__anchor) method from the Hyperledger Fabric Node SDK. 

The method is similar to the [putState]https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-chaincode-node/release-2.0/api/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#putState__anchor) method that is commonly used in Fabric chaincode, except that 
this method expects an argument which specifies which private collection to write  
the key-value pair to.

Similarly, for querying the state of a private data collection, you can use the [getPrivateData](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-chaincode-node/release-2.0/api/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#getPrivateData__anchor) method. 


## Private data in healthcare

In this pattern, we showcase 1 manufacturer, 2 wholesalers, 1 pharmacy and 1 patient connected on the same channel on a blockchain ledger. The manufacturer generates a new drug pill, and sells it at different prices to the two wholesellers. Only the manufacturer and the patient have visibility to the two negotiated prices for this example.

This code pattern is for developers who want to learn how to use the private data collections feature introduced into Hyperledger Fabric. When you have completed it, you will understand how to:

* Create multiple organizations with the IBM Blockchain Platform.
* Create a VueJS web app that has multiple dashboards on a Single Page Application, which can communicate in realtime with each other.
* Create a NodeJS server that is deployed to Kubernetes on IBM Cloud.
* Use private data collections to enforce data privacy between organizations on the same channel.

# Architecture flow

![Architecture flow](docs/doc-images/updated-arch-flow.png?raw=true)

1. The blockchain operator creates a IBM Kubernetes Service cluster and an IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 service.
1. The IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 creates a Hyperledger Fabric network on an IBM Kubernetes Service, and the operator installs and instantiates the smart contract on the network.
1. The Node.js application server uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0.
1. The React UI uses the Node.js application API to interact and submit transactions to the network.
1. The user interacts with the supply chain application web interface to update and query the blockchain ledger and state.

**Important Note:** This pattern is more advanced because it uses four organizations. For this reason, you will likely
have to get a paid kubernetes cluster to run this pattern on the cloud, since a free cluster will not have the CPU/storage 
necessary to deploy all of the pods that we need to run this pattern. There are other patterns that leverage a free
Kubernetes cluster (and only two organizations), so if you want to try that one out first, go [here](https://github.com/IBM/blockchainbean2). 

## Step 1. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/containers-kubernetes).  You can 
find the service in the `Catalog`.

* Once you reach the <b> create a new cluster page </b> you will need to do the following:
  - Choose <b>standard</b> cluster type
  - Fill out cluster name
  - choose Geography: <b>North America</b>
  - Choose Location and availability: <b>Multizone</b>
  - Choose Metro: <b>Dallas</b>
  - Choose Worker nodes: <b>Dallas 10 only</b>
  - Choose Master service endpoint: <b>Both private & public endpoints</b>
  - Choose Default worker pool
  - Choose Flavor
  - Choose Encrypt local disk <b>Yes</b>
  - Choose Worker nodes <b>3</b>
  - Click on <b>create cluster. </b>
<b>The cluster takes around 15-20
minutes to provision, so please be patient!</b>

</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform V2 Beta on the cluster. Again - wait for the Kubernetes service to indicate it was deployed. The service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>



* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start operating on your blockchain network.

## Step 2. Build a network - Certificate Authority

We will build a network as provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform [documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-console-build-network.html#ibp-console-build-network).  This will include creating a channel with a single peer organization with its own MSP and CA (Certificate Authority), and an orderer organization with its own MSP and CA. We will create the respective identities to deploy peers and operate nodes.

## Step 7. Deploy Smart Contract on the network

* #### Install a smart contract
* Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/IBM/private-data-collections-on-fabric
  ```
  - Click the <b>Smart contracts</b> tab to install the smart contract.
  - Click <b>Install smart contract</b> to upload the medrec smart contract package file.
  - Click on <b>Add file</b> and find your packaged smart contract <b>private-data-collection.cds</b> . It is the file in the `private-data-collections-on-fabric/chaincodePackage` directory. 
  - Select all peers - we need to install the contract on each peer.
  - Once the contract is uploaded, click <b>Install smart contract</b>.

* #### Instantiate smart contract
  - On the smart contracts tab, find the smart contract from the list installed on your peers and click <b>Instantiate</b> from the overflow menu on the right side of the row.
  - On the side panel that opens, select the channel, `mychannel` to instantiate the smart contract on. Click <b>Next</b>.
  - Select the organization members to be included in the policy, `manufacturermsp`, `w1msp`, `w2msp`, `pharmacymsp, patientmsp`.  Click <b>Next</b>.
  - Select the peer to approve proposals for instantiating the smart contract. Select <b>Manufacturer Peer</b> from the drop down.
  - Setup private data collection. Click on <b>Add file</b> and find your private data `.json` file <b>. To learn more about private data collection go to the following site [ibp-console-smart-contracts-private-data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-smart-contracts#ibp-console-smart-contracts-private-data).private-data-collection.cds</b>. It is the file called `collections_config.json` in the `private-data-collections-on-fabric/private-data-collections-on-fabric/server` directory. 
  - Give <b>Function name</b> of `Init` and leave <b>Arguments</b> blank.
  - Click <b>Instantiate</b>.

## Step 8. Connect application to the network

* #### Connect with sdk through connection profile
  - Under the Instantiated Smart Contract, click on `Connect with SDK` from the overflow menu on the right side of the row.
  - Choose from the dropdown for <b>MSP for connection</b>, `manufacturermsp`.
  - Choose from <b>Certificate Authority</b> dropdown, `Manufacturer CA`.
  - Download the connection profile by scrolling down and clicking <b>Download Connection Profile</b>.  This will download the connection json which we will use soon to establish connection.
  - You can click <b>Close</b> once the download completes.
  - Copy and paste the contents of the downloaded file into `web-app/server/ibpConnection.json`. Our config files will use this file to communicate with the 
  CA nodes to be able to register users to transact on the network.
  - Go into `private-data-collections-on-fabric/web-app/server/config` and then change each of the
  five files to include the CAURL from the IBM Blockchain Platform. This will help us enroll an 
  admin user to each of the respective Certificate Authorities we created on the IBM Blockchain Platform. You can find the CaUrl by clicking on each of the CA nodes, and then by clicking on the 
  gear icon. 
  ![caUrl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/75277614-305c1d00-57bd-11ea-99f1-1921e202f674.png)
  - Once completed, each of the five files in the `private-data-collections-on-fabric/web-app/server/config` directory will look like the following, taking configPatient.json as an example:

  ```
  {
  "connection_file": "ibpConnection.json",
  "appAdmin": "admin",
  "appAdminSecret": "adminpw",
  "orgMSPID": "patientmsp",
  "caUrl": "https://********.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:7054",
  "userName": "patientAdmin",
  "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
  }
  ``` 
  Note that my containers are located in us-south, so your URL will look different based on location. 
  

## Step 9. Register Org Admin Users
  - go into `private-data-collections-on-fabric/web-app/server` and then run the `./enrollAllAdmin.sh` script. Your output should look like the following:

  ```
  server$ ./enrollAllAdmin.sh 
  msg: Successfully enrolled admin user manufacturerAdmin and imported it into the wallet
  msg: Successfully enrolled admin user w1Admin and imported it into the wallet
  msg: Successfully enrolled admin user w2Admin and imported it into the wallet
  msg: Successfully enrolled admin user patientAdmin and imported it into the wallet
  msg: Successfully enrolled admin user pharmacyAdmin and imported it into the wallet
  ```
  - Nice job! You now have admin identities for each of your organizations, and you can start 
  adding registering more users.
  - You're now ready to start the application!

  
## Step 10. Run the application

- In a terminal window, navigate to the directory private-data-collections-on-fabric

- Install the dependencies 

  ```bash
  cd server
  npm install
  ```

  - Start the application

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
